## **Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Downloader and Preprocessor (CPAC Pipeline)**

This project provides a Python script designed to run in **Google Colab**, enabling:

- Automatic download of a subset of 250 subjects from the **ABIDE** dataset using the **CPAC** pipeline.
- Extraction of preprocessed functional MRI images (`func_preproc`).
- Creation of a clean CSV file containing key phenotypic information (diagnosis, sex, age, site).
- Compression of the images and CSV into a `.zip` file for easy download.



## Features

-  Automated download using **Nilearn**.
-  CSV generation for subject-level metadata.
-  Compression of images + metadata into a single archive.
-  Download-ready from the Colab environment.
